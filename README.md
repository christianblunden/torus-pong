## Torus Pong: Massively Multiplayer Online Pong!

Torus pong is a re-imagining of Pong, designed to be played by large
numbers of people. When you connect you will be put into a game
board. Your paddle is at the top, and all of the other paddles will
belong to your opponents. The flying dots are balls.  The objective of
the game is to hit the balls with the paddle. You will score a point for
every hit. It's that simple!
